# Bundle Pricing for [BoldRadius Solutions](http://boldradius.com)

## Abstract

This exercise is a common problem in e­commerce and brick-and-mortar retail systems.

A customer shops from some form of catalog, selecting items and quantities they wish to purchase. When they are ready, they “check out”, that is, complete their purchase, at which point they are given a total amount of money they owe for the purchase of a specific set of items.

In the bounds of this problem, certain groups of items can be taken together as a “bundle” with a different price. For example, if I buy a single apple in isolation it costs $1.99, if I buy two apples it’s $2.15. More complex combinations are possible. For example, a loaf of bread “A” purchased with two sticks of margarine “B” and the second stick of margarine is free.

The same item may appear in more than one bundle (_i.e._, any one “cart” of items might be able to be combined in more than one way).
